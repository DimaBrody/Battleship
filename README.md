# Battleship

Simple game, written in Kotlin language. This code can help you if you began to use kotlin and want to implement it in your libgdx project. I used straightforward extension functions for different actors, customizing framework actions with lambdas and a bit of features of kotlin collections. 

##### There's a gif which displays a few seconds of gameplay:

  Furthermore, there is a poor Java code,rapidly written by me in 2018 inside the 'java-code' folder in this repository. You can find here  few gradle files and 'src-java' folder which contains that code, so you can compare it.

>If you want to try the game, look for the apk on this path: 
'android\build\outputs\apk\debug'. 

>The main code is located on: 
'core\src\inc\brody\bs'. 


# Good luck!
