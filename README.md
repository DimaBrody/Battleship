# Battleship
Battle Ship Game
<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple game, written in Kotlin language. 
This code can help you if you began to use kotlin and want to implement it in your libgdx project. I used straightforward extension functions for different actors, customizing framework actions with lambdas and a bit of features of kotlin collections. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The main code is located on *'core\src\inc\brody\bs'.* <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is a poor Java code,rapidly written by me in 2018 inside the 'java-code' folder in this repository. There is few gradle files and 'src-java' folder which contains that code, so you can compare it if you want.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to try the game, look for the apk on this path: *'android\build\outputs\apk\debug'.* <br /><br />
# Good luck!
